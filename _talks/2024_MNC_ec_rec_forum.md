During the 2024 MÃ©tis National Council Economic Reconciliation in Richmond BC, I spoke on a panel aiming to demystify common misconceptions regarding technology, and how to apply digital technology in the realm of business. My portion of the panel was focused on the latest trends within the technology space, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and web3 technologies. My focus was primarily on the field of AI, its evolution, and how to ethically apply these technologies in business. I also touched on the key takeaways and lessons regarding the advancement and accessibility of technology, which includes inequality with access to digital resources, especially for Indigenous communities, and the reckless advancement of large technologies companies.
