In this talk, I explore the transformative potential of Large-Language Models (LLMs) in addressing the translation challenges faced by low-resource Canadian Indigenous languages. Focusing on ethical AI development, my study investigates the feasibility of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, incorporating innovative techniques like prompt engineering and few-shot testing. By applying these models to bridge the translation gap, I aim to enhance linguistic accessibility, preserve cultural nuances, and promote inclusivity. This work not only delves into the technical aspects of machine translation but also emphasizes the ethical considerations of AI in the context of Indigenous languages. Through this research, I envision contributing to the revitalization and preservation of Indigenous languages by harnessing the power of cutting-edge AI technology.
