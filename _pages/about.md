AI Researcher, public speaker, and former leader of an award-winning Indigenous rocketry team - Cameron Bishop's diverse experiences exemplify a multidisciplinary approach to innovation and impact. Currently pursuing a M.ASc in Computer Engineering and AI, Cameron investigates the groundbreaking potential of large-language models for the translation of endangered Canadian Indigenous Languages, such as Inuktitut and Cree. Their work, featured at talks across Turtle Island, from AISES to the Vector Institute, champions ethical, and culturally sensitive applications of AI and Indigenous languages, to catalyze preservation and revitalization.
